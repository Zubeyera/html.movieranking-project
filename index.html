    A well told series of young independent friends in search of true happiness.

 <h3>Anikulapo</h3>

 Natural, culture influenced movie which has a sequel. The actors delivered their roles uniquely and the movie is packed with emotions.

 <h3>Love in a Pandemic</h3>
 <p></p>
 A unique love Story of a young Customer Representative in a middle of a Pandemic.

 <h3>Gangs of Lagos</h3>
 <p></p>
 My one time favoite. An elaborate slow-mo fight scenes, and the constancy of close-ups when characters express grief. Fully packed with lessons.

 <h3>A Tribe called Judah</h3>
 <p></p>
 A story of five brothers who come together to save their mother by doing what they thought was best. Well delivered emotions through the Actors.
